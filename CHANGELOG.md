- **System Uptime**: Replaced hardcoded "2.8h" UI fallback with real kernel-sourced uptime telemetry from `gopsutil/host`.
- **Capacity Parity**: Corrected "Memory (Est)" and "Disk (Est)" labels in `Dashboard.jsx` to reflect actual total hardware capacities instead of hardcoded 16GB/200GB averages.

## [2.4.0-alpha] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- **Phase 23: Real-Time Storage Analytics (Completed)**:
    - **Agent**: Implemented `disk.IOCounters` collection for precise Read/Write IOPS and Throughput monitoring.
    - **Backend**: Updated InfluxDB schema and API handlers to persist and serve granular disk rates (MB/s).
    - **Frontend**: 
        - Replaced mock I/O graphs with a **Live Throughput Visualizer** powered by 15-minute telemetry history.
        - Implemented **Dynamic Unit Scaling** (GB/TB) for storage metrics to handle smaller cloud volumes accurately.
        - Connected "Read/Write IOPS" cards to real-time kernel metrics.

    - Integrated direct `top -b` stream into the secondary HUD module.
    - Implemented robust unescaping logic on the frontend to handle double-escaped newline characters in JSON payloads.
    - Updated Dashboard layout with neon-accented system metrics (Uptime, CPU, Mem, Disk).

### Fixed
- **Emergency Disk Recovery**: Resolved a critical "0B Available" condition caused by ClickHouse `system.trace_log` bloat (31GB) and identified subsequent InfluxDB WAL write failures due to "ghost" disk exhaustion from leftover load test artifacts (~10GB).
- **Database Maintenance**: Applied a permanent **2-day Retention Policy (TTL)** to internal ClickHouse system logs and established a routine for purging stress-test files from `/root/`.
- **Frontend Formatting**: Fixed "Waiting for terminal output" stuck state by adding helper logic to unescape `\n` and `\\n` sequences.
- **History Data Integrity**: Fixed "Empty Graph" issue by assigning the `Timestamp` field in the backend Flux query response loop.
- **Chart Precision**: Corrected frontend slicing logic in `Storage.jsx` to ensure the most recent 60 telemetry points are visualized (fixing the "Zero-Load" stale view).
- **Deployment Safety**: Standardized build-exit-code verification and added mandatory synchronization delays (`sleep`) to resolve "Text file busy" race conditions during rapid updates.
- **Multi-Node Rollout**: Successfully verified the real-time telemetry pipeline across the distributed fleet (`<SERVER_IP>`, `77.42.67.214`, `77.42.84.21`), standardizing on `/opt/datavast` deployment paths and explicit `SERVER_URL` connection strings.
- **Connection Reliability**: Fixed a "Connection Refused" loop where remote agents defaulted to `localhost:8080`; implemented verified `SERVER_URL` environment injection.
- **Data Transit Diagnostics**: Identified silent metric loss between Agent and Server caused by both JSON tag mismatches and manual mapping omissions in the sender client; established payload instrumentation as a standard debugging procedure.
- **Storage Resilience**: Documented "Persistent Ghost Fullness" where InfluxDB WAL writes fail due to intermittent I/O pressure or inode exhaustion despite free disk space.
- **Code Optimization**: Successfully removed all instrumentation and debug logic (`fmt.Printf`) from the production agent and backend after verifying 1.3 GB/s throughput handling.

- **Deployment Locking**: Resolved "Text file busy" errors during SCP by implementing remote `pkill` checks prior to binary transfer.
- **Environment Variable Syntax**: Fixed `nohup` startup issues over SSH by using `export VAR=VAL;` syntax to ensure variables are correctly passed to background processes.
- **Multi-Node Deployment Verification**: Implemented MD5 checksum comparison between local and remote binaries to verify successful updates on worker nodes:
    - `77.42.84.21` (root) - Verified.
